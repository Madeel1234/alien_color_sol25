//Alien Color: Imagine an alien was just short down in a game. create a variable called alien color and assign its a value 
// of green, yellow or red.
//write an if statement to test whether the alien's color is green. if it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.
// Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails (the version that fails will have no output)  
//write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.
